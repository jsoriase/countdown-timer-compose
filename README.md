## :scroll: Description
Basic countdown timer app built in compose


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
App developed for the second week of the Android dev challenge. I started toying around with the very basics of animations.
I think that the idea of this week was to use the state management provided by compose, but I'm using a viewmodel. I might change it to test it later, however i find using a viewmodel more practical and it probably is the way to go in more complex projects.
